  <h3>Starting point for Certification Project III</h3>
  <p>Added a really basic button as an example of interaction between the HTML and scripts via event-listeners.
    We also have some really basic styles, so the colour of this text should be violet. We even kept a utils directory,
    so if you want, you can move some accessory functions to that
